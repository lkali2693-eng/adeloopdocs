## Overview

Adeloop provides all the familiar Jupyter-like features you expect, enhanced with cloud capabilities for improved performance and collaboration.

Jupyter-like features in Adeloop allow you to work with code and data interactively. This includes:

- Variable persistence across cells
- Sequential execution counting
- Rich output display (DataFrames, plots)
- Dataset integration
- Magic commands and shell access

## Core Features

### Variable Persistence

Variables defined in one cell execution persist across subsequent executions:

```python
# First cell
x = 10
y = 20

# Second cell - variables x and y are still available
z = x + y
print(z)  # Output: 30
```

This persistence lets you build analyses incrementally while maintaining your workspace state.

### Execution Count Tracking

Each code execution gets a sequential number to track operation order:

```python
# This will be [1]
data = [1, 2, 3]

# This will be [2]
data.append(4)

# This will be [3]
print(len(data))  # Output: 4
```

### Rich Output Display

Adeloop supports interactive visualization of various data types:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# DataFrames display as interactive tables
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "A": [1, 2, 3],
    "B": [4, 5, 6]
})
result = df

# Plots render inline
plt.plot(df["A"], df["B"])
plt.title("Sample Plot")
plt.show()
```


### Dataset Access

Selected datasets are automatically available as DataFrames:

```python
# Direct access (recommended)
print(paie.head())
print(paie.shape)

# Also available as df1, df2, etc.
print(df1.head())
print(df2.head())
```


## Best Practices

1. **Variable Management**
   - Clear unused variables with `%reset`
   - Use descriptive names
   - Check memory usage with `df.info()`

2. **Data Handling**
   - Preview data before operations
   - Use efficient formats (Parquet)
   - Handle large datasets in chunks

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep cells focused and small
   - Add markdown cells for documentation
   - Use sequential execution order
